/** A FlagStaff object represents a flag on a flagstaff.
 *   The flagstaff has a pole that is FLAGSTAFF_HEIGHT units high.
 *   It has a flag whose position can be anywhere from the bottom of the pole to the top

 *   The constructor specifies the position of the base of the flagstaff.

 *   The bottom left corner of the flag is initially at the bottom of the pole.
 *   The flag is FLAG_SIZE units high.
 *   The flag can be raised or lowered.
 *
 *   The flag can be as simple as a blue square, but you can draw a more fancy flag if you want
 *
 *   The class has three methods:
 *     - raise(double dist), which changes the flag position on the staff but does not let it go over the top of the flagstaff
 *     - lower(double dist), which changes the flag position on the staff but does not let it go below the bottom of the flagstaff.
 *           Both methods change the field, but do not redraw the flag.
 *     - redraw() which draws the flagstaff [UI.drawLine(....)] and the flag [UI.fillRect(....)]
